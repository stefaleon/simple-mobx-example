MobX is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React. It helps you manage the state of your application by providing a simple and reactive way to synchronize data between your components.

At its core, MobX follows the principle of observables and reactions. Observables are the state variables that you define and want to keep track of, while reactions are functions that are automatically re-executed whenever the observables they depend on change. This reactive nature allows your components to automatically update whenever the relevant data changes.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how MobX works:

First, you need to install MobX and its React bindings by running the following command:

```
npm install mobx mobx-react
```

Next, let's consider a simple counter application. We'll create an observable state for the counter value and define two actions to increment and decrement it:

```javascript
import { observable, action } from 'mobx';

class CounterStore {
  counter = observable.box(0);

  increment = action(() => {
    this.counter.set(this.counter.get() + 1);
  });

  decrement = action(() => {
    this.counter.set(this.counter.get() - 1);
  });
}

const counterStore = new CounterStore();
export default counterStore;
```

In the code above, we define a class called `CounterStore`, which contains the observable `counter` and two actions: `increment` and `decrement`. The `@observable` decorator marks the `counter` variable as an observable, which means that any component that accesses it will be automatically updated when it changes. The `@action` decorator marks the functions as actions, which modify the state.

Now, let's create a React component that uses the counter store:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { observer } from 'mobx-react';
import counterStore from './counterStore';

const Counter = observer(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Counter: {counterStore.counter}</h2>
      <button onClick={counterStore.increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={counterStore.decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
});

export default Counter;
```

In the code above, we import the `observer` function from `mobx-react`. By wrapping our component with the `observer` function, we ensure that it re-renders whenever any observable value it depends on changes. Inside the component, we display the `counter` value from the `counterStore` and bind the `increment` and `decrement` actions to the corresponding buttons.

With this setup, whenever the user clicks the increment or decrement buttons, MobX will automatically update the `counter` value in the store and trigger a re-render of the `Counter` component, reflecting the updated value on the screen.

This is just a basic example, but MobX can handle more complex scenarios with multiple stores and dependencies between them. It provides additional features like computed values, reactions, and middleware for advanced state management.
